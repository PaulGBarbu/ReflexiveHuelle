# ReflexiveHuelle

Open the Project in the IDE of your choice.  
In the main function fill out the matrix, and run the program.  

It should open the browser with a drawn graph of the reflexive closure (Reflexive HÃ¼lle)

If you are using *Intellij* you need to do the following, otherwise you'll run into an warning Message
Go to File >> Settings >> Build, Execution, Deployment >> Debugger
then check the Allow unsigned requests. (Tick mark that)

To draw the Graph I've used [Springy](http://getspringy.com/) / [Springy Github](https://github.com/dhotson/springy/)
